<h2 class="p1"><b>Tony began his career with the Los Angeles Police Department, Scientific Investigation Division, Latent Print Unit, on January 26, 1996 as a Forensic Print Specialist II.Â  After successfully completing his probation and the Department Rating Of Promotability training and testing, he advanced to the level of FPS III by February of the following year.Â  As an FPS III, Tony responded to all types of crime scenes to develop and recover latent finger and palm print evidence left behind by the perpetrators of these crimes. He would then enter the evidence into the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) to search over 10 million finger and palm print booking arrest cards for possible matches to the latent print evidence.Â  Tony also analyzed latent print evidence and testified in court on his findings.Â  His experience as a latent print examiner was utilized greatly in training and or providing instruction and advice to less experienced examiners.</b></h2>

<p class="p1">As shown above: Co-workers honored Tony's memory with a permanent plaque along side another recently deceased SID (Scientific Investigation Division) colleague.</p>

<h2 class="p1"><b>Tony was extremely knowledgeable in computers. Â In early 2000 he was requested to assist in establishing connectivity with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Integrated AFIS database utilizing the Universal Latent Workstation (ULW), a software program supplied at no cost by the FBI to the LAPD's Latent Print Unit. The successful installation of this program led to more than a dozen of cold case homicides, dating back to the 1970's, with new suspects identified and re-opened the cases.Â  Because of Tony's knowledge of the FBI and Department Of Justice (DOJ) AFIS databases, he was one of two members assigned to the LPU's cold case team that originated between 2001 - 2002.Â  Tony was also called upon to provide training on the various databases to his peers as well as to Finger Print Experts assigned to the Identification Section of the Records and Identification Division and even helped the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Latent Print Unit connect into the system.</b></h2>

<h2 class="p1"><b>Tony was a team player and always willing to help the LPU in various tasks to improve the work environment and moral of the unit. Â On two separate occasions, he particpated in the removal, procurement and installation of modular furniture, cubicles and workstations. Without his hard work and extra effort, the project might not have been possible.</b></h2>
<h2 class="p1"><b>Tony recently and vigorously joined the ranks of an EAA Union Steward participating in Union Steward meetings and Â training. Â His years of experience in the LAPD added tremendous value to the EAA Union Stewards ranks.Â </b></h2>
<h2 class="p1"><b>Â </b><b>Tony had a pleasant, friendly, and humorous personality, always participating in Unit celebrations and assisting with the preparations for these activities.Â  He got along well with everyone he came in contact with and was extremely helpful to everyone. Â His presence within the Latent Print Unit, the LAPD and as an EAA Union Steward will be greatly missed.</b></h2>
