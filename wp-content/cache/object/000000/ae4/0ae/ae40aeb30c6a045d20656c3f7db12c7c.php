The Engineers and Architects Association (EAA) represents approximately 4,500 working men and women, who work in hundreds of locations around the City of Los Angeles.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Since Mr. West arrived at the EAA, he has lead and coordinated EAA political activities; organized events;Â conducted membership meetings; and met with the City of Los Angeles Mayor and Council numerous times. Mr. West was alsoÂ the Chief Negotiator during the most recent EAA MOU negotiations. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">In a short period of time, Mr. West has been able to engage EAA Members, Community Organizations, City, County, and State Elected Officials, transforming EAA into a more progressive, community-engaged, and well-respected union throughout the City of Los Angeles.</span>

In addition, Mr. West was actively engaged in institutional self-defense against other trades attempting to perform electrical work.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Mr. West was instrumental in a jurisdictional victory over solar/photovoltaic installations that has resulted in over one million man-hours to date for IBEW members in Los Angeles County. Before working for IBEW Local 11, Mr. West worked for the Ironworkers Trust Fund in Pasadena, and was a wage and hour litigation associate at the law firm of Weinberg, Roger &amp; Rosenfeld in Los Angeles.</span>
