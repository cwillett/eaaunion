<div style="text-align: justify;">[youtubefeeder]</div>
<div>

<span style="color: #000000;">The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) represents approximately 675,000 members, who work in a wide variety of fields, including utilities, construction, telecommunications, broadcasting, manufacturing, railroads, and government. The IBEW has members in both the United States and Canada and stands out among the American unions in the AFL-CIO because it is among the largest and has members in many skilled occupations.Â </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">IBEW was formed in 1891 by a group of electricians, who wanted a safer workplace, fair wages, and, in general, a respect for the services they rendered to their communities through their labors. In 1891, there were no training programs, no safety regulations, no medical plans, no pension or retirement plans, and nearly half of all electricians were being killed on the job. Because IBEW nourished the needs of these workers, it has grown from a handful of pioneers to the largest electrical union in the world. However, IBEW is not about only growing business or organization, it's a fraternity. The IBEW is made up of working men and women in the electrical industry, committed to bettering themselves and the industry. Neither the IBEW nor the electrical industry is made better unless all, who labor in the industry, are secure in their employment, receive fair wages, and have training programs, pension plans, as well as dental and medical plans for themselves and their families.</span>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Objectives of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Are:</strong></span></span></span></span></h4>
<ul>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><strong><span style="color: #000066; text-decoration: underline;">GOVERNMENT WORKERS</span></strong></span></span></span></h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div><span style="color: #000000;">A sizable segment of IBEW members work for the U.S.Â and Canadian governments. Hardly an agency of theseÂ governments does not need trained IBEW members to carry out its purposes. In naval and coast guardÂ shipyards, naval ordnance plants and various defenseÂ activities, electricians, linemen, gyro and electronics technicians, electric-crane repairmen, and others are essentialÂ to the defense of our nations and the safety of our people.Â IBEW members work aboard ships, on all types of transmission lines, in all kinds of shops providing maintenanceÂ to federal buildings and equipment, on communicationsÂ work of every type, on navigational locks and dams, onÂ hydro and steam-driven electric power generating plants,Â and on numerous jobs in every branch of government service.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Â </span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">They are employed in many federal agencies, bureausÂ and departments; such as each branch of the armed services, the General Services Administration, Bureau ofÂ Reclamation, National Park Service and Department ofÂ Veterans Affairs. They maintain the electrical and electronicÂ machinery, which prints U.S. stamps and currency, and theÂ machinery, which prints U.S. laws and other governmentÂ documents. IBEW members work on such installations asÂ the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Bonneville PowerÂ Administration, and in national laboratories like SandiaÂ and Brookhaven. In Canada, IBEW members perform highly skilled electronics work in several different departmentsÂ of the Treasury Board of Canada.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Â </span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">They are predominantlyÂ electronic technicians whose work covers operational, scientific, and research &amp;Â development apparatus in severalÂ government departments; such as the Coast Guard, nationalÂ defense, science, foreign affairs, international trade, publicÂ works and airports.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Â </span></div>
<div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Because the lifestyles of people in the United States andÂ Canada are directly bound to the abundant use of electricity through the electrical products, which have become anÂ essential part of everyday life, manufacturing workers areÂ an important segment of the IBEW. Many of the comfortsÂ and conveniences we are accustomed to in our homes, atÂ our workplaces, and during our recreational time, are theÂ direct result of the labor of those we represent. The highlyÂ diversified list of products manufactured by IBEW members includes broadcasting and entertainment equipment,Â electric motors, generators, household appliances, light fixtures, medical equipment, switchgear, and telecommunications equipment.</span></div>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000066; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">OTHER TRADE CLASSIFICATIONS</span></span></span></strong></span></h3>
<span style="color: #000000;">It is a daunting task to list and describe the numerous andÂ varied jobs in which IBEW members take part. Hundreds ofÂ thousands of IBEW members undertakeÂ the tremendous job ofÂ performing all the electrical tasks that give our countries theÂ greatest production potential in the world.Â Many are marine electricians, who work on ships and inÂ naval yards around the coastlines of our countries. ManyÂ electricians perform unusual functions such as servicingÂ jukeboxes; running electrically operated â€œtoteâ€ devices ofÂ parimutuel systems at racetracks; and providing the complex lighting arrangements integralÂ to the attractions atÂ various entertainment venues. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Many others engage in theÂ crucial work of keeping Americans and Canadians healthyÂ and their countries strong, working with radar and onÂ nuclear projects and on x-ray and other medical equipment. Â Thousands of IBEW members work in the nationalÂ space program. Others are involved in renewable electricalÂ energy sources such as solar photovoltaic, geothermal,Â wind, biomass, wave, etc., and other distributed energyÂ installations such as fuel cells, microturbinesÂ and the like.Â Office workers, particularly those in our utility, telecommunications and manufacturing fields, and maintenanceÂ workers, who keep electrical installations and equipmentÂ running, form a vital segment of the IBEW. Â </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">In whatever industry they work, at whatever jobs theyÂ perform, IBEW members find themselves in a field in whichÂ change occurs constantly. This change, of course, consists ofÂ advances in technologyâ€”increasing use of computers andÂ high-technology manufacturing, construction and communications methods, for example. But change has also occurredÂ in the structure of the electrical industry; that is, our traditional classifications and jurisdictions are becoming moreÂ interdependent among the various branches.Â IBEW members must prepare for such change throughÂ continued training and education in the technologies ofÂ the future, and by understanding and adapting to the factÂ that technology and changes in the organization of workÂ will spur the creation of new classifications.</span>
